## These two functions will create a matrix which can have the inverse
## calculated of them and store them in the cache.

## This function will check to see if a matrix already exists in the 
## cache and return this, else if there is no matrix in the cache then
## it will create one.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## This will return a matrix which is the inverse of object x if x is
## not an inverse matrix

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
